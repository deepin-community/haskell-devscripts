Description: Tools to help Debian developers build Haskell packages
 This package provides a collection of scripts to help build Haskell
 packages for Debian.  Unlike haskell-utils, this package is not
 expected to be installed on the machines of end users.
 .
 This package is designed to support Cabalized Haskell libraries.  It
 is designed to build a library for each supported Debian compiler or
 interpreter, generate appropriate postinst/prerm files for each one,
 generate appropriate substvars entries for each one, and install the
 package in the Debian temporary area as part of the build process.
 .
 This package doesn't provide functionality for generating coloured
 documentation and is mostly intended for bootstrapping a new
 architecture. If you want coloured documentation, use
 haskell-devscripts.
